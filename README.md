# iOSMAME
Simple test app for `libmame` from [MAME4iOS](https://github.com/yoshisuga/MAME4iOS)

## how to build
* get a copy of `libmame-ios.a`
    - clone the `modern-mame` branch from [ToddLa/MAME4iOS](https://github.com/ToddLa/MAME4iOS/tree/modern-mame)
    - run the `make-ios.sh` script.
    - copy `libmame.a` into the root of this project
    - **OR** this project will automaticaly look for `libmame.a` in `../MAME4iOS`
* change the `DEVTEAM`
* Build and run on a device.

## how to use
* currently you need to have a hardware keyboard for input (fixed soon)
* you need to copy `ROMs` by hand using `Files.app` (like an animal!)
