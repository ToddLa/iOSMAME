# iOSMAME
Simple test app for `libmame` from [MAME4iOS](https://github.com/yoshisuga/MAME4iOS)

**NOTE** this is not meant to be a full `MAME` app for `iOS`, it is just a test app for `libmame`. 

If you want a `MAME` app for `iOS`, get [MAME4iOS](https://github.com/yoshisuga/MAME4iOS)

    - run the `make-ios.sh` script. (in `MAME4iOS` or `MAME` project) 
* get a copy of `libmame-ios.a` 
    - run `get-libmame.sh` (in this project)
* change the `DEVTEAM`
* Build and run on a device.

## how to use
* you need to copy `ROMs` by hand using `Files.app` (like an animal!)
